# STM-skeleton
STM offers a comprehensive range of services, including the creation of web projects. One of their specialized services involves the development of web projects that utilize the FastAPI framework for the backend and React for the frontend. This combination of cutting-edge technologies ensures a robust and modern web application.

## STM Web Project Skeleton Description
The STM's web project skeleton provides a solid foundation for building web applications. It includes:
Directory Structure: A well-organized directory structure that separates backend and frontend code, making it easier to manage and maintain the project.
Backend Configuration: Pre-configured settings for the FastAPI backend, including routing, authentication, and database connectivity.
Frontend Setup: A base setup for the React frontend, including essential libraries and tools for state management, routing, and styling.
API Integration: Integration between the backend API (built with FastAPI) and the frontend components (built with React), enabling seamless communication between the two parts of the application.
PostgreSQL Database: The application employs PostgreSQL as the relational database management system. PostgreSQL's reliability, extensibility, and advanced features make it a preferred choice for storing and managing structured data. The backend communicates with the database to store, retrieve, and manipulate information.
Docker Containerization: The skeleton includes Dockerfiles for both the frontend and backend components. Docker provides a consistent and isolated environment for development, testing, and deployment. This approach ensures that the application runs consistently across different environments, minimizing potential deployment issues.
docker-compose.yml: The docker-compose.yml file orchestrates the deployment of the frontend, backend, and database containers. It simplifies the setup by defining the services, their configurations, and dependencies. With a single command, developers can start the entire application stack, facilitating collaboration and testing.
